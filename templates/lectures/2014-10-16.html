	<h2>Problem Description</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
	<p>
	You're a thief and you break into a house. Your bag (knapsack) can only carry so much weight. Knowing the weight and
	value of every item in the house, what is the maximum value you can take back with you, without exceeding the carrying
	capacity of your bag?
	</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<p>
	Given a set of $n$ values and weights: $v_1, v_2, \ldots$, and $w_1, w_2, \ldots$ and a maximal carrying capacity $W$,
	what's the maximum $v_{k_1} + v_{k_2} + \ldots$ such that $w_{k_1} + w_{k_2} + \ldots \le W$. In this case,
	$k_1, k_2, \ldots$ are the indices of the items we chose.

	<h2>Naive Solution</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
	<p>
		The naive solution in this case is to simply choose all possible combinations and then pick the maximal one
		satisfying the constraint.
	</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<p>
		This is bad. There are $2^n$ different item combinations to pick from, so the run time would be exponential, which
		certainly won't fly in a contest. There must be a better way.

	<h2>How to be more clever</h2>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Can we be greedy?</h3>
		<p>At first glance, this may actually work. Perhaps we have a knapsack with max weight 6, two items of weight 1 with
		value 3, and a single item with weight 4 but value 5. A greedy algorithm might take the heavy item of weight 4, and
		fit no more items, giving a total value of 5. However, the optimal is clearly 6 here. So greedy doesn't really work.
		</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Subproblems</h3>
		<p>
		You may not notice this at first, but whenever you choose an item you've reduced the problem. By putting an item of
		weight $w$ into the bag, you've reduced your knapsack to a smaller one ($w$ less to be precise). Furthermore, you've
		now got one less item to pick from.
