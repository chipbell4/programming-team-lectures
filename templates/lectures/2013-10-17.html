<h6>Lily's Birthday Party</h6>
<p>
This problem essentially asked you to enumerate every combination
of $k$ children from a set of $n$ children.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
With <code>itertools</code> in python, this is trivial:
<pre><code class='python'>from itertools import combinations
kids = ['April', 'Andy', 'Chip']
for subset in combinations(kids, 2):
	for kid in subset
		print(kid)
</code></pre>
The python website also hints at 
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations">how they implement it</a>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h6>What if you don't have itertools?</h6>
<p>
Imagine a recursive formulation for generating the subsets. We will need
to recursively call the combination builder on the remainder of the list 
(so we don't get duplicates) for <strong>each possible list tail</strong>.
Our base case? An empty size has no printout.
</p>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
</p>
<pre><code class='python'>def print_subset(L, size, printout=''):
   if size is 0:
      print printout
      return

   for k in xrange(len(L)):
      print_subset(L[k+1:], size-1, printout + ' ' + L[k])
</code></pre>

<h6>Windows</h6>
<p>
	We want to simulate a window click, but need to determine which
	window was clicked. This problem is not terribly difficult, but
	good data structure use is critical.
</p>
<p>
Here are our data structures
<ul>
	<li>
		A <code>Window</code> class that stores its own location, and can 
		determine if a click occurred within it (via an $x$ and $y$ coordinate).
	</li>
	<li>
		A stack of <code>Window</code> objects, ordered by who's on top, i.e.
		the topmost window is index 0, while the bottom is index $n-1$.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h6>The algorithm</h6>
	<ul>
		<li>Create your window stack from the input parameters.</li>
		<li>
		For each of the clicks
		<ul>
			<li>Loop over each window, seeing if the click occurs in that window.</li>
			<li>
				If it does occur at some index $k$, report: <code>window k+1</code> 
				(since the windows are 1-indexed).
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section id='spiral'>
	<h6>Spiral of Theodorus</h6>
	<p>
		We have this spiral generated by a special pattern. We need to extrapolate that
		pattern to higher numbers. Notice that the cases they provide are easy, but the
		input could be <strong>very</strong> large. This throws out some tricks like 
		memoization and just looping. We're going to have to find a closed form!
	</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h6>Polar Coordinates</h6>
	<p>
	If we switch to polar coordinates, the $x,y$ becomes an $r,\theta$. The
	closed form for $r$ is easy: $r = \sqrt{n + 1}$. We could write $\theta$ as
	as a sum
	\[
		\theta_n = \sum_{i=1}^n \arctan{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}
	\]
</section>
<section>
	<h6>A Weird (unobvious) Observation</h6>
	<p>
	If we actually code up this angle formula, we actually can find a pattern:
	\[
	\theta_n = 2\sqrt{n} + C
	\]
	where $C = -2.157782996659 \ldots$
	</p>
	<p>
	Why? The basic idea is if you expand the power series for $\arctan{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}}$
	inside of the sum, you get $2\sqrt{k}$ plus a couple of other terms that are
	relatively small. A $n \rightarrow \infty$ these terms get so small they 
	essentially become a constant. Here's a 
	<a href='http://mathoverflow.net/a/3444'>proof sketch</a>
	</p>

<section id='pen'>
	<h6>Pen Counts</h6>
	<p>
This problem is asking us to calculate, given some integer $n$, the number
of triangles with perimeter $n$ and integral side lengths. Another way of
thinking of this is that we have an $n$ and we want to know how many solutions
are there to the 
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation">Diophantine Equations</a></i>
$n = a + b + c$, where $a \le b \le c$ and $a + b \gt c$.
</p>
<p>
<a href='http://www.acmgnyr.org/year2012/c.c'>The solution</a> 
covers a lot of the cases better than I thought to do, so we can look at
it instead.
