<h3>Basic Rules</h3>

	<li>Teams of 4</li>
	<li>Only two at the computer at a time</li>
	<li>Bring as much reference material as you like</li>
	<li>Three Hours</li>
	<li>8-ish problems (sometimes more)</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the time</h3>
<p>The competition can fly by. The problems move fast, and many years all problems are solved. Time is of the essence.</p>

<h3>About the Two-At-A-Computer Thing</h3>
<p>
This generally is not a big deal. However, do be prepared to pair program (which is a good thing).
